Some cool stuff this octopress thingy.
Some more cool stuff.

## An H2 header

Maybe i'll even add some code. You know, because I can!

```java
public interface Fixer<T> {
    boolean fixIt(T target) throws UnfixableException;
}

Economy portugalEconomy = Economy.init("portugal");
Fixer<Economy> economyFixer = economy -> tryToFixIt(economy);

economyFixer.fixIt(portugalEconomy); // boom, throws exception!
```
The code should be properly formatted now. Cool stuff bro!
What about some more text. It never hurts to have a lot of text! Alot and alot and alot and alot and alot.
