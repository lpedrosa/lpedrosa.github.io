# Hello there!

I am [Luis Pedrosa](https://github.com/lpedrosa), a software engineer that occasionally takes on
other hats.

Sometimes I help with *Product* and *Sales*, but I love to code:

- I like to learn more about the product domain I am working on, and how users perceive it.
- I like mentoring and helping other people grow. Teams are *most of the times* more important
  than individual effort.

I am mostly comfortable with Java, but I have done Typescript, .NET 6, Python and others.

I've been working remotely for [tru.ID](https://tru.id/) for the past 3 years, to build a better way
to trust your digital identity.
